1,"Trump’s Promises to Kim Jong-un Leave U.S. and Allies Scrambling",New York Times,"Helene Cooper, Mark Landler",15,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/world/asia/us-trump-north-korea-credible-military-exercises.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,WASHINGTON,"President Trump praised the strongman tactics of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and dismissed American military exercises with South Korea as a waste of money on Friday, as his administration and allies scrambled to accommodate the president’s promises to Mr. Kim after their historic summit meeting this week.  The Pentagon and Seoul moved toward canceling a large-scale and long-planned military exercise that was set for August, Defense Department officials said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped up days of talks with top officials in South Korea, Japan and China, where he sought to maintain American steadfastness in the region.  In a Friday morning interview on the White House lawn, Mr. Trump echoed what his critics have said: That his meeting in Singapore would elevate Mr. Kim’s status as a credible world leader. By Mr. Trump’s telling, it was part of a strategy to lower tensions with North Korea.  “I went there, I gave him credibility,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s great to give him credibility.”   North Korea’s extravagant coverage of the meeting, said Joseph Y. Yun, a former State Department official who negotiated with North Korea, suggested that Mr. Kim might want a different relationship with the United States. But that does not mean he is willing to give up his weapons.  “I don’t think our side has recognized that the price is gone up,” Mr. Yun said. “We’re going to have to pay more to get smaller concessions.”"
2,"Trump Agrees: Meeting With Kim Jong-un Gave North Korean Leader ‘Credibility’",New York Times,"Eileen Sullivan",15,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/trump-kim-jong-un-credibility.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,WASHINGTON,"President Trump said on Friday that his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un gave credibility to the North Korean leader, whom critics call a brutal dictator. The president also called Mr. Kim “the strong head” of the communist country, adding: “He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.”  Asked to clarify his comments about people sitting up, Mr. Trump later said he was kidding.  The president has heaped praise on Mr. Kim since their summit meeting on Tuesday in Singapore, where the two leaders discussed denuclearizing North Korea.  Critics feared the meeting would elevate Mr. Kim’s status as a credible leader in the world. It ended with neither a firm agreement about how the North plans to eliminate its nuclear weapons program nor a timeline for doing so. The president saw the meeting as a positive development.  “I went there, I gave him credibility. I think it’s great to give him credibility,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on the White House lawn with “Fox and Friends.”  After the Singapore meeting, Mr. Trump called Mr. Kim, 34, “a very talented man” and referenced his ability to take over the country at such a young age. And, on Friday, Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim got along very well.  “He is the head of a country, and I mean he is the strong head. Don’t let anyone think anything different. He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same,” Mr. Trump said.  Later, Mr. Trump clarified that he was only kidding, telling a reporter, “You don’t understand sarcasm.”"
3,"U.S. Insists Sanctions Will Remain Until North Korea Denuclearizes",New York Times,"Jane Perlez and Choe Sang-Hun",14,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/world/asia/mike-pompeo-north-korea-sanctions.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,BEIJING,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Asian powers on Thursday that President Trump was sticking to demands that North Korea surrender its nuclear weapons, as he sought to hold together a fragile consensus on maintaining tough sanctions against the North despite Mr. Trump’s declaration that it was “no longer a nuclear threat.”  At a news conference in Seoul, South Korea, Mr. Pompeo softened some of the president’s recent comments — but did not retract them — and insisted that United Nations sanctions would remain in place until North Korea had accomplished “complete denuclearization.”  “We are going to get the complete denuclearization,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters. “Only then will there be relief from sanctions.”  He made the same point later Thursday in Beijing, where he met with China’s president, Xi Jinping. But China had already shown signs of breaking ranks on tough enforcement of the sanctions against its neighbor and trading partner, saying that with North Korea now at the negotiating table, they could legitimately be eased.  The absence of any mention of a longstanding American demand that North Korea must agree to verification of its nuclear dismantlement presented a major stumbling block to progress, he said.  “North Korea is nervous about verification and the U.S. wants verification,” he said.  Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that his trade dispute with China might have resulted in weaker Chinese enforcement of sanctions against North Korea, but he refrained from strenuously objecting.  Mr. Xi “really closed up that border. Maybe a little less the last couple of months. That’s O.K.,” he said.  “We’re having very tough talks on trade,” he added. “And I think that probably affects China somewhat. And I think, over the last two months, the border is more open than it was when we first started.”"
4,"The Obama-Trump Grand Strategy",New York Times,"Ross Douthat",12,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/obama-trump-north-korea-summit.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,NONE,"One of the paradoxes of Donald Trump’s election was that it seemed like a dramatic repudiation of Barack Obama — after the first black president, a birther; after a cool liberal academic, a roaring populist; after a multicultural “world man,” an American nationalist — and yet it happened at a time when Obama was quite popular. Ben Rhodes, the bright young salesman for Obama’s foreign policy, offered this explanation for the paradox in his recent book: “When you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change.”  This is a reasonable general explanation for the strange phenomenon of the Obama-Trump voter. But watching the Trump-Kim reality television show play out this week in Singapore, it’s worth noting a more specific continuity between the two presidencies — between Obama’s foreign policy strategy and what Trump promised on his way to the Republican nomination and the White House.  Of course the foreign policy differences between the two presidencies are obvious — just look at the Iran deal, or the Paris climate change accords, or their differing attitudes toward Israel or Saudi Arabia, Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau.  But there is also a mirror-image quality to their gambits and ambitions. Trump is trying to make a deal with North Korea, a last Cold War holdout, much as Obama did with Cuba. Trump is angering a traditional set of allies (the Europeans and now Canada) while pining for a détente with an authoritarian rival (Russia); Obama had a similar approach to realignment in the Middle East, angering the Israelis and Saudis while seeking an accommodation with Iran.  At the same time, the Trump partisans and apolitical normies who like the North Korea summit need to recognize that the problems that beset Obama’s attempt at “offshore balancing” could beset Trump’s efforts as well. Hegemony’s burdens are considerable, but often when the hegemon pulls back the new equilibrium turns ugly enough to pull us right back in.  That’s what happened in the Middle East in Obama’s second term, where dealing with Iraq from “offshore” led to the rise of the Islamic State and the Iranian nuclear deal may have stoked conflict in Yemen and Syria. It could easily happen under Trump in northern Asia as well, depending on how his approach looks from Pyongyang and Beijing.  As Tyler Cowen writes in one of the more optimistic takes on the summit, the wooing of Kim represents a gamble that the North Koreans really want to change their posture, to reap the possible benefits of normalization, even to enter America’s orbit instead of Beijing’s. (If Kim’s regime became merely authoritarian rather than totalitarian, imitating the House of Saud instead of Stalin, the last scenario isn’t entirely fanciful.)  But we simply don’t know whether Kim’s regime still envisions an endgame in which America retreats and South Korea submits — in which case the idea of permanent détente would be a fantasy. We also don’t know how the Chinese (and their potential allies of convenience in Moscow) would react to North Korea swinging into our orbit; there are ways in which peninsular stabilization could lead to regional destabilization. And given that Trump is a longtime huckster who’s feeling his way entirely by instinct, there should be a lot of skepticism about how well this is likely to turn out.  That skepticism, though, needs more sophistication than the “Can you imagine how the right would react if Obama cozied up to a murderous dictator like this?”/“Well, the left used to love it when Obama cozied up to murderous dictators!” argument that’s being carried on by Trump’s liberal and conservative critics on Twitter.  The reason that this “mirror, mirror” argument is possible is that Trump and Obama, for all their differences, are dealing with the same brute facts: American power is limited, America’s grand strategy is outdated or nonexistent, and being a superpower in the 2010s requires making harder choices and more unpleasant bargains than it did circa 1999.  Trump’s Korean bargain may be a bad one, or it may evaporate. But what Trump and Obama have in common — a skepticism about received foreign policy wisdom, a recognition that some burdens need to shift and some alliances need to change, an accurate read on what domestic public opinion will bear — is something the statesmen who succeed them need to share."
5,"North Korea Is a Nuclear Power. Get Used to It.",New York Times,"Vipin Narang, Ankit Panda",12,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/trump-kim-summit-denuclearization-north-korea.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,NONE,"North Korea has arrived as a nuclear power, and there is no going back. Once the reality-show theatrics of the Singapore summit meeting subside, we are left with the reality that North Korea was just recognized as a de facto nuclear weapons power.  President Trump went to the meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea to try to take the keys to Mr. Kim’s nuclear kingdom. Whatever the terms of the statement released at the end of the meeting, Mr. Kim has not committed to anything concrete. He is not surrendering North Korea’s nuclear weapons and has walked away the big winner.  North Korea declared its nuclear weapons force technologically complete at the end of 2017, with its third successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, less than a year later, North Korea’s nuclear power is politically complete, thanks to the legitimacy that comes from a handshake with an American president. Mr. Kim did what neither his father nor grandfather could do before him: sit down and negotiate with a president of the United States. The Singapore summit meeting looks indistinguishable from a meeting between the leaders of two states with normal diplomatic relations. But this is far from where Washington and Pyongyang have ever stood. It was Mr. Kim’s development of nuclear weapons — and the credible means to deliver them to America — that made the meeting possible.  Didn’t he just agree to “work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”? He did. Just like his grandfather’s deputies did in 1993. That phrase — “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” — is a term of art that the United States and North Korea can interpret to suit their interests.   American allies in the region are not so sanguine. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea was taken by surprise by the sudden announcement of an end to joint military exercises. But it is Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan who is perhaps most terrified, because United States-Japan exercises may be the next to go. Mr. Trump has chafed at the cost of America’s deployment in East Asia, and Mr. Kim led him right where he wanted to go. The only thing that may actually be dismantled is the architecture of America’s longstanding military alliance with Japan and South Korea.  That serves broader Chinese strategic interests in the region. With the United States pulling back from its alliances, China moves closer to being the dominant power in northeast Asia.  The small but significant silver lining is that the United States and North Korea are no longer trading threats of pre-emptive strikes and nuclear war. Mr. Trump’s top-down negotiations could lead to a stable deterrence relationship between the two countries. But they remain separated by divergent interests and mutual distrust.  The Singapore summit meeting also generates significant risks outside of the relationship between the United States and North Korea. Mr. Kim showed the world that it is possible to leave the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, develop nuclear weapons and win a summit meeting with the president of the United States. The lesson for states like Iran is simple: Acquire a thermonuclear ICBM that can threaten America and you too can have your Singapore declaration — a fast track to nuclear status.  This summit meeting — unlike previous moments in United States-North Korea history — was Mr. Kim’s moment to come out as the world’s ninth current nuclear power."
6,"Trump Concession Over Military Drills Blindsides Many South Koreans",New York Times,"Choe Sang-Hun",12,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/south-korea-trump.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,SEOUL,"For South Koreans who have long felt threatened by nuclear war, seeing President Trump and North Korea’s leader shake hands and sign an agreement on improving ties brought relief, if not closure, to the decades-old standoff.  But the optimism was quickly tempered by a shocker.  Hours after the summit meeting with Kim Jong-un in Singapore was over, Mr. Trump said he planned to end annual joint military exercises with South Korea, emphasizing their expense.  Mr. Trump suggested that he was ending the “very provocative” war games as an incentive for North Korea to denuclearize, granting the North one of its most avidly sought objectives even before the country has begun dismantling its nuclear weapons.  North Korea has long insisted that it would not relinquish its nuclear weapons program unless the United States removed its “hostile policies.” The North has cited military drills between the United States and South Korea as a prime example of American hostility, calling them rehearsals for invasion. Washington and Seoul have always dismissed such accusations as propaganda.    North Korea and the United States made similar, broadly worded commitments in the past, in nuclear disarmament accords signed in 1994 and in 2005, for example. Those agreements collapsed in later talks on what actions North Korea should take toward denuclearization and how to verify them, as well as what incentives Washington should provide in return.  The lack of such details in the Trump-Kim statement suggested that despite many rounds of lower-level talks before the summit meeting, wide mistrust persists between the two sides.  “The joint statement is not the end but just the beginning” of what could be a bumpy road toward denuclearizing North Korea, said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at the Seoul-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. “Both sides probably realized that they needed to build confidence first rather than making excessive demands.”  Officials said the Tuesday statement was more likely to succeed because it had been signed and endorsed personally by two strong-willed heads of state.  But critics said Mr. Trump gave away too much too soon to Mr. Kim, helping the dictator debut as a major international diplomat and implicitly recognizing North Korea as a de facto nuclear weapons state while failing to commit Mr. Kim to a specific timetable for denuclearization.  In North Korea, the video images of Mr. Kim with Mr. Trump will be a propaganda bonanza for the young North Korean leader, they said.  “The whole summit was a big win for Kim Jong-un,” said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul."
7,"Dennis Rodman Praises Kim-Trump Meeting: ‘I’m So Happy!’",New York Times,"Austin Ramzy",11,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/dennis-rodman-interview-kim-trump.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FNorth%20Korea,NONE,"The former N.B.A. star Dennis Rodman has always had an ability to grab the spotlight. There was the time he donned a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself. There were his stints on reality television and as a pro wrestler. And there was his unusual relationship with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to whom he sang “Happy Birthday” in 2014.  So when President Trump and Mr. Kim began their historic meeting in Singapore on Tuesday, it seemed inevitable that The Worm, as Mr. Rodman is known, would make an appearance.  The retired basketball star has met both men and forged unlikely ties to North Korea, traveling to the isolated authoritarian state several times and once taking a team of retired basketball players to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to play before Mr. Kim.  In an emotional interview with CNN shortly after Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim shook hands, Mr. Rodman expressed his hopes for the meeting, declaring, “Today is a great day.”  Despite the earlier criticism from Mr. Trump, Mr. Rodman said that the president had acknowledged his contribution to ties with North Korea ahead of the Singapore meeting. A secretary for the president had called, Mr. Rodman said. “She said, ‘Dennis, Donald Trump is so proud of you. He thanks you a lot.’”  “And that means a lot,” he added. “After all these years, the fact that I somewhat had something to do with this North Korea situation, but I don’t want to take any credit, where credit is due. I think we all need to take credit.”  While Mr. Rodman said nothing about the many obstacles to a lasting peace between the two sides, he said contact between the leaders was an important start.  “Let’s just hope for the best,” Mr. Rodman said. “We don’t need a miracle, we just need the doors to be open so we can start afresh and make this world a better place.”"
8,"Will America Lose Canada?",New York Times,"Stephen R. Kelly",11,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/opinion/will-america-lose-canada.html,DURHAM,"The worst thing you could say about previous American presidents and their sleepy approach to Canada was that they took their polite northern neighbors for granted.  But as President Trump jetted away from the wreckage of the Group of 7 summit meeting in Quebec this weekend, he plunged American-Canadian relations into a dive so steep it provoked nosebleeds on both sides of the border.  He called the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, dishonest and weak. His advisers accused the Canadians of stabbing Mr. Trump in the back as he winged his way to a meeting with his new best friend, Kim Jong-un of North Korea. And one aide said a “special place in hell” was reserved for Mr. Trudeau, who had the temerity to say to Mr. Trump what the president likes to say to everyone else: Don’t push me around.  It’s not every day you see an American president trade a two-century relationship with a reliable neighbor for what could amount to a one-night stand with a ruthless dictator in Singapore. Mr. Trump may well think bullying Canada is cost-free. After all, three-quarters of its exports go to the United States, which makes retaliation risky for Canada. But having limited options does not mean having none. Reversals like these come with a price, although how and when the United States will pay depends on many factors.  Besides fighting together in two world wars and Korea, since 1957 Canada and the United States have jointly monitored the skies over North America in the North American Aerospace Defense Command. In the Cold War years, we watched together for Russian bombers. Now it’s mainly North Korean missiles. The United States has no other defense relationship this close.  It has also worked closely with Canada to monitor and secure another of Mr. Trump’s pet concerns, the border. American and Canadian law enforcement officials jointly patrol our shared waterways. Canada and the United States exchange data on border crossers. Canada even permits American customs agents to screen passengers headed for the United States in eight Canadian airports.  When America-bound jumbo jets needed a place to land after the United States closed its airspace on Sept. 11, Canada took them in, an act of unselfish generosity I witnessed while serving at the United States Embassy in Ottawa.  What would a split with Canada look like? Obviously, we’re not talking about anything like a North American Cold War. But even a minor deterioration in the relationship would have significant consequences.  In the short term, Canada seems willing to go toe-to-toe on trade. Canadian officials are already drawing up lists of American exports they will slap with duties. Such tariffs on specific products produced in politically important areas in the United States can inflict a lot of pain. Canada, for example, is the largest market for American agricultural exports.  Longer term, and likely to our detriment, Canada is looking to reduce its dependence on American goods. It already has a free trade agreement with the European Union, for example, something the United States has failed to achieve. Canada also remains part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump noisily rejected upon taking office. Even Canada’s oil — the country supplies 60 percent of the petroleum the United States now imports — could find more lucrative markets in Asia once needed pipelines are built.  It’s unlikely even Mr. Trump could cause the United States to “lose” Canada, especially since the two are still attached by a 5,525-mile-long border. What we could lose is a quiet habit of friendship and cooperation that has made us safer and more prosperous.  Can Kim Jong-un match that?"
9,"Trudeau’s Challenge: Managing Trump and Domestic Politics",New York Times,"Ian Austen",11,6,2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/canada/canada-milk-dairy-industry-trudeau-trump.html,OTTAWA,"The security fences are coming down. And the world leaders have jetted off.  But for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, the troubles have just begun.  After the disastrous finale of the Group of 7 summit meeting, Mr. Trudeau is now caught in a tight spot between the unpredictable President Trump and the powerful Canadian dairy industry, the current target of Mr. Trump’s escalating trade threats. The prime minister’s challenge is how to manage both the most important Canadian ally and his own domestic politics.  “Trudeau is in a very difficult place because the G-7 summit signals the approach the Trudeau government took to deal with the Trump administration has failed,” said Wesley Wark, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa. “The charm offensive has produced little of what the prime minister hoped.”  Even before Mr. Trump came to power, Mr. Trudeau, and his closest aides and cabinet members rushed to connect with the new president and his advisers. And despite Mr. Trump’s unpopularity in Canada, Mr. Trudeau scrupulously avoided criticizing the president.   “They are trying to protect a few thousand farmers at the expense of millions of Canadians,” he said.  There have been signs that Canada might consider some changes to supply management. Professor Wark, however, and many others, said that by bringing this issue into his trade battle, Mr. Trump had ensured that Canada would not back down when it came to the system, which also covers poultry and eggs.  Mr. Trudeau’s options now are not certain.  Professor Lilly, the former adviser to Mr. Harper, said she did not believe that Mr. Trudeau’s efforts to influence the president’s inner circle had been in vain and that they might yet produce some kind of settlement.  Professor Wark said he anticipated that Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet would now be giving more interviews to the American news media and redoubling their efforts to build support with members of Congress and state and local politicians.  But Professor Granatstein, who is retired from York University in Toronto, said he did not think that Mr. Trudeau had a winning hand to play.  “You either resist and ruin the economy or you give in and get creamed in the next election for selling out,” he said, adding that one thing now seems clear. “I thought that anti-Americanism was over in Canada. Clearly I was wrong.”"
10,"Before the Smiles, Mounting Tensions Between Trudeau and Trump",New York Times,"Catherine Porter",8,6,2016,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/world/canada/canada-trudeau-trump-us-group-of-7.html,LA MALBAIE,"Hours before President Trump landed in Canada on Friday, 18-year-old allegations that Justin Trudeau once groped a reporter resurfaced on a website sympathetic to the president.  Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.  But it only added to the mounting tensions between Mr. Trudeau, now the Canadian prime minister, and Mr. Trump as the president arrived for the Group of 7 summit meeting that had become so fractured before it started that many observers were calling it the “G-6 plus 1” — with Mr. Trump being cast as the irrational, irascible and dangerous outsider.  When the two leaders finally met on the grounds of a grand Quebec hotel on Friday, they had a brief, cordial exchange and made no show of the antagonism between them that has grown over the past week. Instead, Mr. Trudeau gave his telegenic smile, and Mr. Trump gave a thumbs up for the cameras.  It has always been an article of faith that maintaining good ties with the United States was essential for Canada, but with Mr. Trump’s imposition of tariffs and unfounded accusations of 200-year-old acts of aggression by Canada against the United States, Canada’s priorities have changed. Now Mr. Trudeau will be expected to protect not only the economy of Canada, but also its dignity.   If any place could soothe the tempers of the leaders, it would be the site of the summit meeting. With the site’s rolling forests that meet the tidal waters of the St. Lawrence River, it was easy to see why the sleepy village of La Malbaie was once a vacation spot for Hollywood stars and American presidents alike. (President William Howard Taft owned a luxurious villa here.)  A giant fence was installed around the meeting site, and at its base on the water’s edge, the town set a small “free speech zone” for protesters, but it remained as languid as the rest of town. When meetings were beginning in earnest, reporters outnumbered a handful of North Korean defectors who had come from Toronto to protest Mr. Trump’s coming meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, whom they called a “murderer and dictator.”  “The stress levels aren’t on the outside of the G-7,” joked Mayor Michel Couturier of La Malbaie, who is still hopeful the meeting will buff some of the town’s former tourism luster. “It’s mostly inside the G-7 red zone.”"

Of all the countries that could feel the sting of President Trump’s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Canada, the long-suffering and restrained American trading partner, is at the top of the list because it is the No. 1 exporter of both to the United States.  But as the news settled on Friday, Canadians took another breath and hoped that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the army of cheerleaders he has deployed to charm American officials since President Trump was elected would cajole the United States back from the edge of a trade war.  Rather than erupting in rage, Mr. Trudeau — ever conscious of how much his country’s economy relies on the United States — remained calm and firm, counting off the reasons that Mr. Trump’s move defied economic sense.  But he also called the American plan “a repudiation of our friendship.”  Jean Simard, the president of the Aluminum Association of Canada, whose industry’s nine smelters export about $5.6 billion across the border every year, said it was “very difficult to accept being treated this way.”  He added: “It’s not how to deal with a country that has been the most strategic ally of the U.S.A. since the Second World War.”"

As the United States under President Trump becomes increasingly protectionist, Canada is moving in the opposite direction.  Along with 10 other nations, Canada is trying to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal championed by the Obama administration and abandoned by Mr. Trump. It is in trade talks with numerous other countries and free-trade groups — including India, Japan and Singapore. And in late September its broad free-trade pact with Europe clicked into action.  Now Mr. Trudeau is widely expected to add free-trade talks with China to Canada’s list of negotiations at his meeting with President Xi Jinping.  Put it all together and it suggests that Mr. Trudeau, who announced that “Canada is back” after his election two years ago, is positioning his country to fill a void left by the United States by becoming the global champion of free trade. At the same time, Canada’s own auto parts factories would be facing increased competition from Asia.  While Canada’s trade pact with Europe was initially Quebec’s idea, Ms. Anglade, the province’s deputy premier, said that looking beyond North America would mitigate but not solve Canada’s most pressing trade issue.  “First and foremost we have to have a renewed Nafta,” she said from Quebec City. “We are deeply committed to try to make this happen.”"
